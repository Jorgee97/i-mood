# Base Description

TUI mood tracker


# Future features:

# Basic features I want to add
- [ ] Save the entries locally to a sqlite file
- [ ] Allow the user to select a mood and add some text for thoughts althougt it shouldn't be required to add text
- [ ] Show a table or lit of entries
- [ ] Add a license


# More advanced feaures (I guess)
- [ ] Stats based on the entries that the user created
- [ ] Allow settings like add moods, saving file location
- [ ] Maybe only allow the opening of the entries by using a password?
- [ ] Show an encouraging phrase
